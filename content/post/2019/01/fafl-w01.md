Fridays are for learning. A new year means the return of my aggressively
non-search-engine-optimized posts on interesting things I’ve seen in the past
week.

This week everyone is still recovering from the end of year period — nothing
kills a work week like a Tuesday holiday — so I’m just giving you a quick
video: Julia Evans from Stripe talking about high reliability infrastructure
migrations at KubeCon North America 2018. It’s ostensibly Kubernetes-focused
but I find a lot applicable to distributed systems in general, and let’s face
it, we are all building distributed systems of one kind or another these days.
You can read Julia’s [own notes on the talk] at her site (recommended as
well). The configuration language mentioned is [skycfg].
