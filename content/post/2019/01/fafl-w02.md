Fridays are for learning. I’m still catching up on re:Invent 2018 sessions,
and these two, both deep dives into DynamoDB, were incredibly interesting to
me.

First is Jaso Sorenson discussing the underlying technical implementation of
DynamoDB in “[Amazon DynamoDB Under the Hood: How We Built a Hyper-Scale
Database (DAT321)]”.  It really helped me understand better why the system
operates the way it does.

And second is Rick Houlihan’s “[Amazon DynamoDB Deep Dive: Advanced Design
Patterns for DynamoDB (DAT401)]”, in which he demonstrates the things possible
to achieve with some creative data modeling to take advantage of the
properties of a NoSQL data store like DynamoDB.
