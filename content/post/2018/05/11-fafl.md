Fridays are for learning.[^1] These are some interesting links for the week
ending May 11, 2018.

[^1]: If your work won’t let you spend even 10-20% of your time keeping up to
      date with your profession, quit your job and find a better one!

A short list this week; I’d encourage you to keep an eye on [PyVideo] for
recordings of talks done this weekend at PyCon US 2018. (Presumably [this
page] will start existing at some point.) Next week I plan to start rounding
up the talks I found most interesting.

* On [structured concurrency in high-level languages], continuing our
series of posts thinking about this topic.

* [Announcing glom] — restructured data for Python.

* For a time there was [an ssh backdoor] in a package on PyPI. Do *you* know
what all your project’s dependencies are doing? (Is this even a tractable
problem to solve?)

See you on the other side of PyCon!
