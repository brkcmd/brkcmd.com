Fridays are for learning.[^1] These are some interesting links for the week
ending May 4, 2018.

[^1]: If your work won’t let you spend even 10-20% of your time keeping up to
      date with your profession, quit your job and find a better one!

* Lots of prominent new releases this week! [Flask 1.0]![^2] [Rancher 2.0]!
[Fedora 28]! [NetHack 3.6.1]! Congrats to all.

[Flask 1.0]: https://www.palletsprojects.com/blog/flask-1-0-released/
[Rancher 2.0]: https://rancher.com/blog/2018/2018-05-01-rancher-ga-announcement-sheng-liang/
[Fedora 28]: https://fedoramagazine.org/announcing-fedora-28/
[NetHack 3.6.1]: https://nethack.org/v361/release.html

[^2]: A sad loss for [ZeroVer](http://0ver.org/) advocates.

* [Jupyter received the ACM Software System Award], joining such highlights of
computing history as NCSA Mosaic, {{< TeX >}},[^3] `make`, and [more]
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACM_Software_System_Award). Heady company for
sure, but well-deserved.

[^3]: If something has a crazy orthography you know I’m gonna make use of it.

* [Interpretable machine learning] is going to become more and more important;
in my opinion black-box “[computer says no]” models will not be tenable much
longer. (See also [`eli5`], very cool work from some colleagues.)

* Asynchronize all the things! [Go with Kafka and MongoDB]; [Python with
Redis].

[Python with Redis]: https://testdriven.io/developing-an-asynchronous-task-queue-in-python

* A faster [Python `datetime` parser].

* Learn you some Python for great good: [metaclasses], [bytecode], and [`else`
clauses for `for` and `while`].

[bytecode]: https://opensource.com/article/18/4/introduction-python-bytecode

* Keeping up [with Kubernetes](http://kubernetesstatus.com/).

* The [state of stateful apps] on Kubernetes.

* Right after [xkcd complained] about Python packaging (and it *is* a mess),
Debian accidentally [broke `python3 -m venv`] in `sid`.  We’re gonna have to
figure this out; hopefully there will be some hallway conversations about this
at [PyCon US 2018] next week.

* What does it mean to [do one thing]?

* Finally, last week’s [deep dive into concurrency] continues to resonate with
me; I suspect its thesis is something that we’ll continue coming back to. In
the meantime, here’s a talk the author did at [Pyninsula] 10 back in January,
in which he live-implements “[Happy Eyeballs]” using these
constraints/foundational pieces:[^4]

[Happy Eyeballs]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Eyeballs

[^4]: The point of the paper being that by adding the right constraints, you
      get better, more elegant foundational flow control elements, as `goto`
      begat `if`, `for`, `while`, <i lang="la">et cetera</i>.
