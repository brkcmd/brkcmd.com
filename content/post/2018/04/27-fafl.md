Fridays are for learning.[^1] These are some interesting links for the week
ending April 27, 2018.

[^1]: If your work won’t let you spend even 10-20% of your time keeping up to
      date with your profession, quit your job and find a better one!

* [Warehouse](https://pypi.org/) is finally, officially, [the new
PyPI](https://blog.python.org/2018/04/new-pypi-launched-legacy-pypi-shutting.html).
Well done to everyone who helped make this happen!

* On making a blog with [more
privacy](https://vincent.bernat.im/en/blog/2018-more-privacy-blog).

* An overview of one of my favorite new(er) Python standard modules,
[pathlib](https://realpython.com/python-pathlib/).

* Python 3.7 implements [PEP 553](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0553/), a
better way of [inserting breakpoints in your
code](https://hackernoon.com/python-3-7s-new-builtin-breakpoint-a-quick-tour-4f1aebc444c).

* Maybe we can figure out when IoT devices are compromised using
[machine learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.04159)?

* Of course, many IoT devices [are insecure and compromise their users
privacy](https://freedom-to-tinker.com/2018/04/23/announcing-iot-inspector-a-tool-to-study-smart-home-iot-device-behavior/)
even when they *aren’t* infected by malware.

* Your deep dive into concurrency for the week: “Notes on structured
concurrency, or: [<code>go</code> statement considered
harmful](https://vorpus.org/blog/notes-on-structured-concurrency-or-go-statement-considered-harmful/).”

* Automatically [provision and manage TLS certificates in
Kubernetes](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/).

* Microsoft Azure’s [Container
Instances](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-instances/)
(aka *“just run my image in a container already, will ya?”*) are now [generally
available](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-container-instances-now-generally-available/).

* The future of Kubernetes is
[serverless](https://thenewstack.io/the-future-of-kubernetes-is-serverless/).
Agree/disagree?

* Finally, a shout out to [Heptio’s “TGI Kubernetes”
series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvmPtYZtoXOENHJiAQc6HmV2jmuexKfrJ),
live streamed every Friday afternoon at 1 pm US Pacific time
([calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/heptio.com_f73rm4mchnc07nssap47uaa5so%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics)).
(Here’s a sample: [TGI Kubernetes 027: Securing the k8s dashboard and
beyond!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=od8TnIvuADg))

* *Late addition:*  [Ubuntu 18.04 LTS is
