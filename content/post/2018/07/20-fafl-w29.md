A quick update for this week; I’ve been collecting lots of things under my
personal `for:blog` tag, but I’ve been so busy I haven’t had a chance to sort
through and post any recently!

Last week Segment published [a retrospective] on their journey from a monolith
to a system based on (literally hundreds of) microservices and then back, and
it reminded me of [this talk] from Jimmy Bogard in 2017. Enjoy!
