# Tanaka, a simple theme for Hugo.

I developed this theme for my own use, but if you find any part of it useful,
it is released under the terms of [the MIT license].

This theme depends on features present in [Hugo] 0.46 or later.

Settings used by this theme are contained in the theme ``config.toml``, and
may be overridden by specifying your own values for them in your site’s global
``config.toml`` file.
